Note:
	When using load.sql, it seems one has to use the command:
		mysql --local-infile CS143 < load.sql
	For some reason just: mysql CS143 < load.sql doesn't work.

	Mitchell: create.sql, load.sql, query.php, queries.sql (1 of 3)	
	Tremaine: queries.sql (2 of 3), violate.sql (which includes modifying the create.sql file)
